Today the pressure of high population and so many people are taking a toll on nature and creating a lot of stress. The entire system of living beings around the Globe is collapsing. Our planetâ€™s biosystem, which consists of both the chemical and physical environment, is constantly changing, causing our world to deplete gradually. Earlier, humans could not cause much damage the environment, and if they did, it was on a small area of land. However, today the human population is constantly increasing with various technological advancements, automobiles, and more. Today, the environment is about farm fields and agriculture, but it consists of the entire planet. They are thus resulting in a complete disruption and misbalance in our ecosystem. Without realizing the long term consequences, modern people are still continuously using different means of hazardous elements that adversely affect our nature.

Over the years, people were concerned about their health, living conditions, various diseases, pandemics, famines, accidents, and vector borne diseases. The farming and domesticating animals formed new contagious disorders among people, creating new challenges for better health among people.
